**HOMER** is a robust, carrier-grade, scalable Packet and Event capture system and VoiP/RTC Monitoring Application based on the [HEP/EEP](http://github.com/sipcapture/hep) protocol and ready to process & store insane amounts of signaling, rtc events, logs and statistics with instant search, end-to-end analysis and drill-down capabilities.

**HOMER** is already used by large enterprises, voice network operators, voip service providers and traffic carriers worldwide, has been implemented as a service in 3rd party voice platforms and is suitable for production. 

**HOMER** 7+ is designed and delivered as a set of modular components and building blocks to be used stand-alone or in combination with other platforms.
<br/>

##### Core Features
* Based on HEP Encapsulation, available everywhere
* Stand-Alone Capture Servers & Agents for any OS
* Supports advanced SIP, RTP/RTCP Reports, RTC Events and Custom protocols
* Multiple Database backend support for Packets, Logs, Timeseries in parallel
* Dynamic Mapping and Correlation for internal and external data sources
* Made by Humans, and Supported by the best community ever

#### :construction: This is a work in progress, the process and instructions might change at any given time.

## Introduction
Unlike its predecessors, HOMER Seven is completely dynamic, meaning there are many database, timeseries and logging backend combinations possible - even at the same time! This opens up a number of new use-case options some users might find overwhelming at first - don't worry, *its just about freedom of choice!* If you're unsure or just want a stand-alone capture system, please consider using our [Installation Script](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer-installer) on a vanilla system, launching our *ready-to-go* [Docker containers](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer7-docker), or joining our [users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homer-discuss) where our community will welcome and help you move the first steps.
